# Star Wars Card Game

Build an application to select random people or starships and render their details to see
who would win based on a common attribute.

i.e. people have mass and starships have crew. A person with greater mass wins, a
starship with more crew wins.

## Requirements

- The app should render the attributes from the resource in a simple web page that allows you to 'play' the game.
- Once two cards are displayed the app should declare one of the cards a winner based on the higher common attribute.
- Having displayed the winning card, the user should be able to play again using an action button that repeats the same request.

### Optional

- Score counter. If there are two players, left and right, show how many times each
  side has won.
- Option to select which resource to play against
- Use material-ui and display the details in a card https://material-ui.com/components/cards/
